## How to start app

First you must install node.js.

I assume that you have GIT installed.

### `npm install`

Instals all the dependencies.

You can use `npm i` for shorthand.

### `npm start`

Runs the app.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

I started implementing some tests, but I couldn't pass the issue:

https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/issues/610.

## TODO

- Add the Summary Step
- Add the Money Counter
- Add the Tooltips
- Style the whole app to be consistent with the design
